description: Discover and install exact Arete stacks or program SDKs for a Solana application. Use for generic Arete setup, capability discovery, choosing between read/build/subscribe coverage, or managing arete.toml dependencies. For view code use arete-streams; for program operations use arete-programs; for Rust stack definitions use arete-stack-authoring; for hosted publication or deployment use arete-deploy.

# Discover and Install Arete Capabilities

Use this skill to turn an application intent into an exact, installed Arete dependency. Do not guess protocols, stack names, program surfaces, view names, or generated APIs.

## Platform Model

Arete exposes three capability modes:

- `subscribe`: typed point-in-time and live views from a hosted stack.
- `read`: typed program-account and chain reads.
- `build`: typed program instructions, transactions, and flows.

An exact stack descriptor binds selected views, programs, authentication policies, endpoints, and SDK targets. A program descriptor binds a normalized IDL, ProgramSpec, Program Release, Program Read service, and supported SDK targets.

## Health Gate

When environment setup is relevant, run:

```bash
a4 doctor --json
```

Follow the reported `fix` commands when a required check is not ready. If `a4` is missing and setup is within scope, use the current bootstrap instructions at `https://docs.arete.run/agent.md`; do not substitute a Cargo installation from memory.

Do not run setup on every Arete task. A healthy project, a usable generated dependency, or a task that only asks for explanation does not need repeated onboarding.

## Discovery Workflow

Start from the user's intent, not from a remembered public stack:

```bash
a4 explore catalog --query "<intent>" --json
a4 explore catalog --vocabulary --json
```

Use `--concept` or `--category` only with slugs returned by the vocabulary.
Narrow by `--kind program|stack`, `--mode read|build|subscribe`, and
`--target typescript|rust|python` when the request already determines those
constraints.

Read each result's coverage modes. Continue with only the relevant branch:

- `subscribe`: inspect the named stack, then use `arete-streams` for application code.
- A stack result without `subscribe` coverage is definition-only. It installs as a typed SDK and a pinned StackManifest, but nothing is hosted. The user can deploy their own copy after installing it (see `arete-deploy`); do not present it as a live stream until then.
- `read` or `build`: inspect the program surface, then use `arete-programs`.
- No suitable hosted capability and the user wants a custom feed: specify the missing read model, then use `arete-stack-authoring`.
- Publication or hosted lifecycle work: use `arete-deploy`.

Inspect the selected catalog result as an exact install descriptor:

```bash
a4 explore catalog stack <stack-slug> --json
a4 explore catalog program <program-slug> --json
```

If the user or project already supplies a direct reference, these compatibility
forms resolve the same descriptor contract:

```bash
a4 explore stack <stack-ref> --json
a4 explore program <program-ref> --json
```

Catalog contents and capability delivery can change. Do not maintain a static
list of public programs or stacks, infer an endpoint, or treat a search result
as proof that an unreported mode is available.

For reviewed protocol context and callable operation semantics, use the
knowledge layer when available:

```bash
a4 know search --query "<intent>" --json
a4 know program <program-slug> --section surface --json
a4 know program <program-slug> --section instructions --json
a4 know program <program-slug> --section accounts --json
```

Return to the exact catalog descriptor before installation. Treat a descriptor
refusal as “not currently installable.” Do not fall back to an arbitrary latest
IDL, AST, deployment, or release.

## Install the Exact Dependency

Prefer the `installCommand` returned by the exact descriptor. In a project, a
saved dependency updates `arete.toml`, resolves `arete.lock`, and generates
provenance-owned output:

```bash
a4 install stack <stack-ref> --ts
a4 install program <program-ref> --ts
```

Choose `--ts`, `--rust`, or `--python` from the existing project language and the descriptor's `sdkTargets`. Standalone program packaging may support fewer targets than a program bundled in a stack; trust the descriptor and command output.

Use `--no-save` only for a genuinely disposable, one-package generation. Do not hand-edit generated SDKs.

A definition-only stack's generated SDK has empty endpoints until the project records a deployment of it. Deploying it with `a4 up <alias>` (an external mutation; see `arete-deploy`) records the deployment in `arete.toml` and regenerates the SDK.

For project dependency configuration, locked installs, updates, removals, and output ownership, read [references/project-dependencies.md](references/project-dependencies.md).

## Source-of-Truth Order

When sources differ, use this precedence:

1. Generated types and the installed descriptor identity.
2. Current `a4 <command> --help` and `--json` output.
3. Current Arete documentation.
4. These workflow instructions.

Never preserve a stale example merely because it appears in an existing application. Identify the mismatch and migrate it to the installed surface.
